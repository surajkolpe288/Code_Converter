# Code_Converter
A web-based code converter that allows users to input code in one programming language, get a summary of the code, validate the input, and convert it to another language. Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, this app uses server-side endpoints for code validation, summary generation, and conversion.
